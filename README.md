# XKMLGen
A simple, GUI-based XML editor, useful for easy, intuitive and fast editing/creation of XML documents. 

As of today, the features include:
- GUI-based creation and editing of basic XML items (nodes, elements, attributes).
- loading and edition of well-formed (but not valid) XML files.
- export of created XML tree to file.

This application is useful to anyone that needs to create or edit multiple XML easily and fast and not worry about unclosed tags or tag ordering, e.g. in order to test one's application. XKMLGen takes care of the order of tag opening and closing as well as attribute formatting. The user may focus on element names and values instead of thinking about keeping correct document structure.

The application is able to some extent to detect illegal characters in tag names, but if the user really wants to break the rules, it is possible.
